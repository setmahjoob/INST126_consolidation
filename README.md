# INST126_consolidation
This project is an implementation of the Tuple Out Dice Game,  where two players take turns rolling three dice. The objective is to score the most points, or to be the first to reach 50 points. During each player's turn, they can re-roll any dice that are not "fixed," but if they roll three of the same number, they score zero for that turn.
